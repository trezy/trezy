# Trezy

Hi, I'm Trezy (he/him)! 👋🏻 I was born in Texas, grew up in Kentucky, and moved to Wisconsin around 2009. I enjoy nerding out about Universal Basic Income, robots/automation, and Rocket League. 🚀🚗

I'm an open source software engineer working on building software that makes other developers' lives easier. I've worked on some pretty big projects, like [NES.css](https://nostalgic-css.github.io/NES.css/) and [Backbone.Marionette](https://marionettejs.com/). Currently I'm working on...

| Project | Description |

| [`next-safe`](https://github.com/trezy/next-safe) | A library for adding secure headers to your Next.js app |
| [`react-color-mode`](https://github.com/trezy/react-color-mode) | A library for adding support for dark/light mode to your React.js app |
| [`fdgt`](https://fdgt.dev) | A staging API for building things on Twitch |
